Title: Sensemaking is…

----

Text:

- having that crazy morning hunger, but for books and conversations.
- having ten books open on your bedside table.
- to be up at 2 in the morning.
- to see in 4 dimensions: forwards and backwards, by a minute, a day, a month, a year, a decade.
- never having enough.

***

- fitting together fact and opinion, knowing they both belong to truth.
- digging deep so you can tell the real story.
- knowing that the real story isn’t the only story.
- seeing all the shades between black and white.
- being not only comfortable with but diving into ambiguity.

***

- sleeping on it.
- making hard decisions.
- getting your hands dirty.
- being suspicious when someone tells you, “Don’t worry about it.”

***

- stopping in the street.
- remembering that everyone is interesting, even if you have nothing to go on but faith.

***

- playing druid: someone who cultivates, safeguards, and passes on knowledge.
- making sense.
